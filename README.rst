   - Feats

      - run main.py runs searching with browser(firefox)
      - navigates page from page

   - Issues

      - navigating from page 3-4, found error, but some browser didn't.
         - Navigation method should change location based to UI interaction based.

      - search page range(availability) should be considered.
